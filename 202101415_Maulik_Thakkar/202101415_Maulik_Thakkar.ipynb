    "**Columns Present**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) TP2(bar) : The pressure on the compressor.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) TP3(bar) : The pressure at pneumatic pannel.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) H1(bar)  : The pressure generated as a result of pressure drop when the cyclonic separator filter    discharges.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) DV Pressure(bar) : The pressure drop caused as the towers discharge air dryers; a zero value indicates that the compressor is working under load.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Reservoirs(bar) : The downstream reservoir pressure, which should be close to the pneumatic panel pressure (TP3).\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Motor Current (A) : The current of one phase of a three-phase motor is measured; it displays values close to 0A when turned off, 4A while working offloaded, 7A when operating under load, and 9A when it starts functioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Oil temperature (celcius) : Oil temparature on the compressor.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) COMP : the electrical signal of the compressor's air intake valve; it is active when there is no air intake, indicating that the compressor has been turned off or is working in an offloaded mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) DV electric : the electrical signal that regulates the compressor outlet valve; it is active when the compressor is loaded and inactive when the compressor is turned off or in an offloaded state.\n",
    "\n",
    "10) Towers : the electrical signal that defines the tower in charge of drying the air and the tower in charge of draining the humidity removed from the air; while not active, it indicates that tower one is in operation; when active, it indicates that tower two is in operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "11) MPG : When the pressure in the air production unit (APU) falls below 8.2 bar, the electrical signal responsible for starting the compressor under load by activating the intake valve; it triggers the COMP sensor, which behaves similarly to the MPG sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "12) LPS : the electrical signal that detects and activates when the pressure drops below 7 bars.\n",
    "\n",
    "13) Pressure Switch : The electrical signal that detects the discharge in the air-drying towers.\n",
    "\n",
    "14) Oil Level : the electrical signal that monitors the compressor's oil level; it is active when the oil level falls below the expected levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "15) Caudal Impulse : the electrical signal generated by the absolute amount of air going from the APU to the reservoirs."
