### Abstract :
Urban metro systems are the arteries of modern cities, facilitating the rapid movement of commuters and goods. Ensuring the reliability and efficiency of these systems is very important.
Our core objective is to develop predictive models that can accurately forecast the target parameter based on historical data and the interrelationships among these features. By achieving this, we can anticipate parameter fluctuations and performance variations. Such predictive insights empower decision-makers to optimize maintenance schedules, enhance efficiency, and minimize downtime.

### Dataset Description

The dataset contains the data of 7 analog and 8 digital sensors described below.

1) **TP2(bar)** : The pressure on the compressor.

2) **TP3(bar)** : The pressure at pneumatic pannel.

3) **H1(bar)**  : The pressure generated as a result of pressure drop when the cyclonic separator filter    discharges.

4) **DV Pressure(bar)** : The pressure drop caused as the towers discharge air dryers; a zero value indicates that the compressor is working under load.

5) **Reservoirs(bar)** : The downstream reservoir pressure, which should be close to the pneumatic panel pressure (TP3).

6) **Motor Current (A)** : The current of one phase of a three-phase motor is measured; it displays values close to 0A when turned off, 4A while working offloaded, 7A when operating under load, and 9A when it starts functioning.

7) **Oil temperature (celcius)** : Oil temparature on the compressor.

8) **COMP** : the electrical signal of the compressor's air intake valve; it is active when there is no air intake, indicating that the compressor has been turned off or is working in an offloaded mode.

9) **DV electric** : the electrical signal that regulates the compressor outlet valve; it is active when the compressor is loaded and inactive when the compressor is turned off or in an offloaded state.

10) **Towers** : the electrical signal that defines the tower in charge of drying the air and the tower in charge of draining the humidity removed from the air; while not active, it indicates that tower one is in operation; when active, it indicates that tower two is in operation.

11) **MPG** : When the pressure in the air production unit (APU) falls below 8.2 bar, the electrical signal responsible for starting the compressor under load by activating the intake valve; it triggers the COMP sensor, which behaves similarly to the MPG sensor.

12) **LPS** : the electrical signal that detects and activates when the pressure drops below 7 bars.

13) **Pressure Switch** : The electrical signal that detects the discharge in the air-drying towers.

14) **Oil Level** : the electrical signal that monitors the compressor's oil level; it is active when the oil level falls below the expected levels.

15) **Caudal Impulse** : the electrical signal generated by the absolute amount of air going from the APU to the reservoirs.


### Algorithm Used

- For datapreprocessing, we used pandas and numpy libraries.
- For Exploratory Data Analysis , we used matplotlib and seaborn libraries. We used boxplots , pairplots , scatter plots and heatmap to indentify correlation between data of different sensors.
- Though the dataset contained outliers , we used IQR robust scaling.
- We used GridSearch for hyperparameter tuning.
- For regression analysis, we used linear regression , RandomForest regressor and XGBRegressor algorithms.
